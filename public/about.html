<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am an aspiring Software Engineer keen to get back into IT. I am a creative
  individual who finds developing software solutions immensely rewarding. I have
  been intrigued by technologies for as long as I could remember and have always
  wanted to help create robust software systems using cutting edge technologies
  that help progress mankind. Helping with the advancement of humanity through
  technology, is something I am passionate about, which I think I can achieve
  being a software engineer.

  I have a Bachelor Of Engineering degree in Information Technology with a
  history of working for Cisco Offshore Development Centre, world leader in
  providing network solutions. I was recognised with SPARC award from HCL
  Technologies for achieving high level of customer satisfaction which shows my
  positive work ethics.

  The process of contributing to develop a software, then watching it flourish,
  I believe, is extremely rewarding. The best part of having a software
  engineering career for me seems to be the problem-solving aspect - I will face
  numerous challenges, but I will try to solve them utilising the knowledge and
  skills I have acquired previously and with the ones I am constantly learning,
  combined with my creativity and imagination. I am always eager to learn new
  technologies and to utilize my knowledge to my highest ability. Eventually, I
  want to feel proud and satisfied on my performance wherever I work.
